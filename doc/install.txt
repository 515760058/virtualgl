* Obtaining and Installing VirtualGL

	!!! VirtualGL must be installed on any machine that will act as a VirtualGL
	server or as a client for the [[overview.txt#VGL_Transport][VGL Transport]].
	It is not necessary to install VirtualGL on the client machine if using VNC
	or another type of X proxy.

** Installing VirtualGL on Linux

	1. Download the appropriate VirtualGL binary package for your system from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].
		Packages are provided for RPM-based and Debian-based Linux distributions
		that contain GLIBC 2.3.4 or later (including
		[[http://fedoraproject.org][Fedora]] 4 or later,
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[http://www.centos.org/][CentOS]] \
		4 or later,
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise/[[http://www.opensuse.org][openSUSE]] 10 or later,
		and [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] 6.06 or later.)
		{nl}
		!!! If you want to run both 32-bit and 64-bit OpenGL applications using
		VirtualGL on 64-bit Linux systems, then you will need to install both the
		i386 and x86_64 VirtualGL RPMs or both the "virtualgl" and "virtualgl32"
		amd64 DEBs.  (The virtualgl32 DEB is a supplementary package that contains
		only the 32-bit server components.)

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the binary
		package, and issue the following commands:

		RPM-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -e VirtualGL
		rpm -i VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

		!!! You may need to add ''--all-matches'' to the ''rpm -e'' command line if
		you have installed both the 32-bit and 64-bit VirtualGL RPMs.

		Debian-based systems :: {:}
		#Verb <<---
		dpkg -i virtualgl*.deb
		---

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on OS X

	#. Download the VirtualGL Mac disk image
		(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac client.

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on Windows (Exceed)

	#. Download the VirtualGL Client for Exceed installer package
		(''VirtualGL[64]-''__''{version}''__''-exceed.exe'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]].

	#. Run the installer.  The installation of the VirtualGL Client should be
		self-explanatory.  The only configuration option is the directory into
		which you want the files to be installed.

 !!! NOTE: The VirtualGL Client for Exceed installer does not remove any
 previous versions of the VirtualGL Client that may be installed on your machine.
 If you wish, you can remove these older versions manually by using the "Add or
 Remove Programs" applet in the Control Panel (or the "Programs and Features"
 applet if you are running Windows Vista.)

** Installing the VirtualGL Client on Windows (Cygwin/X)

Refer to [[http://www.virtualgl.org/Documentation/Cygwin]].

** Installing VirtualGL from Source

If you are using a platform for which there is not a pre-built VirtualGL binary
package available, then download the VirtualGL source tarball
(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, ''cd VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__, and read the contents of
''BUILDING.txt'' for further instructions on how to build and install VirtualGL
from source.

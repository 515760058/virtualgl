** Additional Requirements for Stereographic Rendering
{anchor: Stereo_Requirements}

	!!! The client requirements do not apply to anaglyphic stereo.  See
	{ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_OpenGL} for more details.

|| || Server || Client ||
| Linux/Unix \
	| 3D graphics card that supports stereo (examples: nVidia Quadro, ATI \
		FirePro.)  The 2D X server should be configured to export stereo visuals. \
	| < \
	|
| Mac/x86 \
	| N/A \
	| 3D graphics card that supports stereo (example: nVidia Quadro.) \
		The 2D X server should be configured to export stereo visuals. \
	|
| Windows \
	| N/A \
	| {list type=ul: \
			{item:3D graphics card that supports stereo (examples: nVidia \
				Quadro, ATI FirePro.)  Stereo support should be enabled in the 3D \
				driver configuration.} \
			{item:2D X server that supports and is configured to export stereo \
				visuals.  (As of this writing, \
				[[http://connectivity.opentext.com][OpenText]] Exceed 3D v8 or newer \
				is the only known Windows X server solution that supports stereo \
				drawing with sufficient performance to be used with VirtualGL.)}} \

** Additional Requirements for Transparent Overlays
{anchor: Overlay_Requirements}

|| || Client ||
| Linux/Unix \
	| 3D graphics card that supports transparent overlays (examples: \
		nVidia Quadro, ATI FirePro.)  The 2D X server should be configured to \
		export overlay visuals. \

* Configuring a Windows Machine as a VGL Transport Client

** Configuring and Optimizing Exceed

If using the VirtualGL Client for Exceed, then add the Exceed path (example:
''C:\\Program Files\\Hummingbird\\Connectivity\\14.00\\Exceed'') to the system
''PATH'' environment if it isn't already there.

*** Disabling Backing Store (Exceed 2008)
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "Other Server Settings" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Performance" applet instead. 

	#. Select the "Performance" tab and make sure that "Default Backing Store" is
		set to "None."

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

*** Enabling MIT-SHM
#OPT: noList! plain!

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
OpenText Exceed to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can significantly
improve the end-to-end performance of the VGL Transport when running over a
local-area network.

The bad news is that this extension is not consistently implemented across all
versions of Exceed.  In particular, Exceed 2008 requires patches to make it
work properly.  If you are using this version of Exceed, you will need to
install the latest
[[http://support.hummingbird.com/customer/cspatches/patches.asp][Connectivity 2008 Service Pack]]
(__OpenText WebSupport account required__.)

Next, you need to enable the MIT-SHM extension in Exceed:

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. Select the "Extensions" tab and make sure that "MIT-SHM" is checked.

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

** Optimizing Cygwin/X

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
Cygwin/X to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can significantly
improve the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline when running over a
local-area network.

To enable MIT-SHM in Cygwin/X:

	#. Open a Cygwin Bash shell

	#. Run ''cygserver-config''

	#. Answer "yes" when asked "Do you want to install cygserver as service?"

	#. From a Windows (not Cygwin) command prompt, run ''net start cygserver''

	#. Add ''server'' to the ''CYGWIN'' system environment variable (create this
		environment variable if it doesn't already exist)

	#. Start or re-start Cygwin/X

	#. Run ''xdpyinfo'' and verify that ''MIT-SHM'' appears in the list of 
		X extensions
